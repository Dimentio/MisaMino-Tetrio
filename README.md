# MisaMino-Tetrio
MisaMino with more features.
1. Tetrio attack table
2. Garbage cap (in tetrio, you will at most accept 8 lines of garbage at a time, which is garbage cap = 8)
3. Delayed attack (in tetrio or jstris, the garbage you sent will not show on opponent's garbage buffer right away) (you can still cancel these delayed garbage with your attack)
